# Macro-League
A tool that gives audible announcments for the game League of legends, Everything in the tool uses Riot Games's official api's and abides by their TOS, the original idea came from this video by Sir Slunt https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIgkeILqbPM.

## Differences from the video version
The issue with the video version is that its limited to only being able to be around 20 minutes long, This is fine for the early game objectives, ie, the first dragon, rift and baron spawn, but there's no way to determine when they have been killed, to start a new timer, this is where Macro-League comes in.
